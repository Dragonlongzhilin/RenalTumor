    # Links refers to a data frame, including source, target, and value columns. Where source and target use the code replacement or directly correspond to the name.
    # Nodes refers to the names of all points, you can get the names in the links or correspond to the codes in the links yourself.
    # Source, target, value corresponds to the value in the links.
    # NodeID corresponds to the name in Nodes. Here, if the corresponding ID is required, the nodes in links need to be numbered starting from 0.
    # NodeGroup, LinkGroup refers to the changes in the colors of the corresponding nodes and connecting lines. If they are grouped, the colors between different groups will be marked differently.
    # Nodewidth refers to the width of the node.
    #Draw the graphics, you can also directly adjust the upper and lower positions of the square in the R window, but it is still recommended to save it as pdata and use AI to adjust
    #nodeWidth The width of each node block
    #nodePadding The vertical interval between each column of node squares
    #width is the horizontal width of the graphic
